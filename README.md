# Link State Routing Protocol Simulation
This project implements a simulator to the Link-State Routing Protocol in Java and JavaFX (for GUI) which mainly have two functions:
* to simulate the process of generating connection table for each router in a given network and,
* to compute optimal path with least cost between any two specific routers. Besides, this project provides both I/O console and GUI interfaces for the user interaction with the simulator. Also, supports for over any initial number of nodes and creation and display of the connection tables by default is enabled as well.
